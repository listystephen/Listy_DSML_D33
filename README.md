# Project Excel: Bike Sales

**Analysis**
**Age, income, and bike purchasing behaviour**
Age 30-40 range has the highest counts of bike purchases, particularly ages 32, 35, 36, 38, and 40. Lower purchase counts are seen in the age group under 30, with some variation as age increases. Purchase counts generally decrease as age increases beyond 50, with a few exceptions.Lower-income levels might limit discretionary spending, affecting bike purchases.Higher-income individuals might have more disposable income to spend on bikes, possibly opting for higher-end models.As people age, physical ability, health concerns, or lifestyle changes might reduce the likelihood of bike purchases. However, those with higher incomes may continue to buy bikes for recreation or health benefits.

**Bike Purchases by Commute Distance and Occupation**

For very short commutes, a higher number of individuals tend to purchase bikes. This suggests that bikes are seen as a convenient mode of transportation for short distances.For longer commutes (10 miles), the number of non-purchasers is almost double that of purchasers. This indicates a marked decrease in bike purchases as commute distance increases significantly.Clerical workers are almost evenly split between purchasing and not purchasing bikes. This balance suggests bikes are seen as equally viable for personal and professional commutes in this group. Management professionals are more likely to not purchase bikes. This might be due to higher disposable income leading to the preference for other forms of transportation or longer commute distances.Manual workers show a slight preference towards not purchasing bikes. This could be due to physical job demands making biking less appealing or practical. Professionals are more inclined to purchase bikes, possibly valuing them for fitness or as a convenient mode of transportation for moderate distances.

**Region-Based Bike Purchases**

The distribution is nearly balanced in Europe, with a slight majority of non-purchasers.In North America, there is a higher proportion of non-purchasers compared to purchasers, indicating a lower inclination towards bike purchases.The Pacific region shows a higher proportion of bike purchasers compared to non-purchasers, suggesting a stronger preference for biking.
The Pacific region has the highest tendency towards bike purchases, while North America has the lowest.North America has a significant number of non-purchasers, indicating potential for increased marketing efforts to boost bike sales.


**Gender-Based Bike Purchases**

The numbers are relatively close, indicating that both genders are almost equally likely to purchase bikes within this dataset. This suggests that bike purchase interest is fairly balanced across genders. Given the almost equal split, marketing campaigns and product designs should be inclusive, appealing to both genders. There is no significant gender-based preference that would require different marketing strategies for each gender.

**Bike purchase vs Car onwers**

Customers with no cars are more likely to purchase bikes. Bike purchasers in this category are almost double the number of non-purchasers. Even with one car, customers still tend to buy bikes more frequently. The number of bike purchasers is higher than non-purchasers. For customers owning two cars, the trend reverses. The number of non-bike purchasers significantly exceeds the number of bike purchasers, indicating that increased car ownership reduces the likelihood of bike purchases. With three cars, the gap widens further with non-bike purchasers being almost twice as many as bike purchasers. Customers owning four cars are least likely to purchase bikes, as indicated by the relatively low number of bike purchasers compared to non-purchasers. the fewer cars a customer owns, the more likely they are to purchase a bike. This inverse relationship between the number of cars owned and bike purchases could be due to various reasons, such as financial considerations, preference for cycling over driving, or less dependence on cars for transportation.


**Conclusion**
This data-driven analysis reveals distinct patterns and opportunities within the bike market. Understanding the interplay of age, income, gender, region, and occupation allows businesses to tailor their strategies effectively. By aligning product development and marketing efforts with these insights, companies can better meet customer needs, enhance satisfaction, and drive growth in bike sales.
